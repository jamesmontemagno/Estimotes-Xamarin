Estimotes-Xamarin
=================

This is a Java Library binding for the [Estimotes SDK for Android](https://github.com/Estimote/Android-SDK). I've also ported the Android sample project to show some of the features in action. It's not a 1-to-1 port, I've made some changes along the way.

Many thanks to James Montemagno for updating this to 1.0.4.2 of Estimotes.

There are two projects:

* `Estimotes.Binding.Droid` - this is the Java Binding library.
* `Estimotes.Droid` - this is a sample project showing how to use the Estimotes SDK for Android in Xamarin.Android project. 

Installation
------------

The binding is [available via NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Estimotes-Xamarin/) :

What About iOS?
